## Good practices for applied machine learning - from model development to model deployment 

üí¨ Speakers: Julia Silge [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) | [GitHub](https://github.com/juliasilge) | [LinkedIn]() & Max Kuhn [Twitter](https://twitter.com/topepos) | [GitHub](https://github.com/topepo) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>The <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org">tidymodels framework</a> is a collection of R
packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. Whether
you are just starting out today or have years of experience with ML, tidymodels
offers a consistent, flexible framework for your work. In this talk, learn how
tidymodels has been designed to promote <strong>ergonomic</strong>, <strong>effective</strong>, and
<strong>safe</strong> modeling practice. We will discuss how to think about the steps of
building a model from beginning to end, how to fluently use different modeling
and feature engineering approaches, how to avoid common pitfalls of modeling
like overfitting and data leakage, and how to version and deploy reliable models
trained in R.</p>

## The R integration in Power BI:  Why R developers should be Interested 

üí¨ Speaker: Ryan E Wade [Twitter]() | [GitHub]() | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrdatageek/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Power BI is a multi-faceted business intelligence tool with built-in data
ingestion, transformation, and visualization features. The learning curve
for Power BI can be steep for many, but fortunately, R users can shorten the
learning curve by leveraging the Tidyverse. In this talk, attendees will get
introduced to how the Tidyverse can shorten the Power BI learning curve and
enable them to perform tasks in Power BI that are not possible using its native
functionality.</p>

## R Package Assessment: Lessons from Pharma 

üí¨ Speaker: Becca Krouse [Twitter]() | [GitHub]() | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>As R users, we make choices daily about what packages to use in our work.
After discovering a package that may suit our needs, we consider its qualities
and make a judgement about whether to invest in its use. Here at GSK, we are
currently forging a path to using R in regulatory settings, which involves
careful curation and assessment of R packages for use on clinical trials
data. While this exercise is formalized for those of us in pharma, attendees
will learn about how related principles can better inform decisions they make
their own workflows, regardless of industry or experience. They will take away
specific qualities that indicate trustworthiness, as well as the importance of
considering the ecosystem as a whole.</p>

## Translating from {tidymodels} and scikit-learn: Lessons from a 'bilingual' course. 

üí¨ Speaker: Kelly Bodwin [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kellybodwin) | [GitHub](https://github.com/kbodwin) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>The friendly competition between R and python has gifted us with two stellar
packages for workflow-style predictive modeling: tidymodels in R, and scikit-
learn in python. When I had to choose between them for a Machine Learning
Course, I said: ¬øPorque no los dos? (Why not both?)</p>
<p>In this talk, I will share how the differences in structure and syntax
between tidymodels and scikit-learn impacted student understanding. Can a
helper function hide an important decision about tuning parameters?  Can a
slight change in argument input influence the way we describe a model? The
answer is a resounding, &quot;¬°S√≠!&quot;</p>
<p>Don't despair, though, because I will also provide advice for avoiding
pitfalls when switching between languages or implementations. Together,
let's think about the power that programming choices has to shape the
mental model of the user, and the ways that we can responsibly document
our modeling decisions to increase cross-language reproducibility.</p>

## censored - Survival Analysis in tidymodels 

üí¨ Speaker: Hannah Frick [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hfcfrick) | [GitHub](https://github.com/hfrick) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-frick) 

üìù Abstract: <p>tidymodels is extending support for survival analysis and censored is a new
parsnip extension package for survival models. It offers various types of
models: parametric models, semi-parametric models like the Cox model, and tree-
based models like decision trees, boosted trees, and random forests. They
all come with the consistent parsnip interface so that you can focus on the
modelling instead of details of the syntax. Happy modelling!</p>

## R, Python, and Tableau: A Love Triangle 

üí¨ Speaker: James Blair [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Blair09M) | [GitHub](https://github.com/blairj09) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blairjm/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Users often want access to more advanced analytic capabilities in their Tableau
dashboards. Together we will walk through an example that highlights how new
open-source packages enable R, Python, Tableau, and RStudio Connect to work
together to enhance business intelligence and deliver real-time insight.</p>

## Dive Deep into Metadata with Tplyr 

üí¨ Speaker: Mike Stackhouse [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mike_at_atorus) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mstackhouse) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-s-stackhouse/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Back in 2020, Atorus first released our package Tplyr. The aim of Tplyr was
to build a reusable framework that makes all the data preparation for clinical
reporting simple ‚Äì and takes the hassle out of tedious things like decimal and
parentheses alignment. But from the beginning, Tplyr was always meant to be
more. Tplyr captures metadata about the table being built, and in Tplyr 1.0.0
we can leverage that metadata to its full advantage. Tplyr now let‚Äôs you dive
in, and for any result provides the traceability of how that result was derived,
and the data used to do-so. In our talk, we will explore this new functionality
built into Tplyr, the mechanics that make it work, and how these new features
are useful in the clinical world and beyond.</p>

## Mobile, Low-Bandwidth and Low-Tech. The Story of Chi-Square Mobile. 

üí¨ Speaker: Aleksander Dietrichson [Twitter]() | [GitHub](https://github.com/dietrichson) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dietrichson/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>This talk discusses how we used R to solve some of the challenges we faced when
all classes were emergency onlined as a result of COVID. Instructors improvised
typically defaulting to zoom, and survey data showed that more than half of
our student population did not have access to a laptop or computer, but all
did have a smartphone. We set out to mitigate this by creating a mobile app
which facilitates a feedback-loop between students and instructors and provides
analytics of this interaction.Starting as a shiny-app with {shinymobile},
we applied linguistic and social network analysis to provide the instructor
with analyses. As the pandemic dragged on the system evolved and became more
integrated with google cloud and the Andoid ecosystem.</p>

## tidyclust - expanding tidymodels to clustering 

üí¨ Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt) | [GitHub](https://github.com/emilhvitfeldt) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilhvitfeldt/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>This talk marks the grand introduction of tidyclust, a new package that provides
a tidy unified interface to clustering model within the tidymodels framework.</p>
<p>While tidymodels has been a leap forward in making machine learning methods
accessible to a general audience in R, it is currently limited to the realm of
supervised learning. tidyclust, by Emil Hvitfeldt and Kelly Bodwin, builds upon
the interfaces familiar to tidymodels users to make unsupervised clustering
models equally approachable.</p>

## Building a client portal app for a mortgage management group with embedded Power BI reports 

üí¨ Speakers: Thomas Wouters [Twitter]() | [GitHub]() | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-wouters/) & Joran De Wilde [Twitter]() | [GitHub]() | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joran-de-wilde-0b952b174/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>With the Dutch Mortgage Portfolio Management Group we built a client portal for
their customers wanting insights into their mortgage investment portfolio. This
was done with a Shiny app that runs in Azure App Service, with plumber APIs
serving portfolio reports, and embedded power bi reports with clear and easy to
maintain dashboards.</p>
<p>Last year we saw a lot of great content on how to combine Tableau with Rstudio
Connect, in this talk we have answers for the Power BI users. An interesting
example of combining self-service BI with serious data science.</p>
<p>When Microsoft itself mentions
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07j22d4B_hA&amp;t=3517s">&quot;we did not know how to do this</a>,
you know you have an interesting topic for rstudio::conf.</p>

## Packages and Process 

üí¨ Speaker: Ellis Hughes [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thebioengineer) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ellishughes) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Data Scientists have a unique position to drive change and efficiency within
organizations workflows. By simplifying workflows to its core expectations,
we can design with purpose. Process and software are harmonized to reduce
risk and streamline the overall system. At GSK, we are developing capabilities
and challenging traditional processes. We must do this while still meeting
regulatory compliance requirements that can be complicated by historical
inertia. I will talk about how my team is using this approach to develop R
packages in tandem with process changes that are leading to wins. Attendees of
my talk with leave with an understanding of how to do the same.</p>

## Designing a Socially-Critical Data Science Course 

üí¨ Speaker: Brian Danielak [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Capbri) | [GitHub](https://github.com/briandk/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandanielak/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>I'll discuss designing a socially-conscious and socially-critical data science
course. This talk will be interesting to anyone who designs or delivers
educational opportunities for young data scientists. The topic is important
because data science is not value neutral. Learners should understand how
data and data analyses can encode biases and assumptions. Particularly when
we collect data from or about people, we should ask who is privileged or
disadvantaged by how we gather and analyze that data? Attendees will learn
how I‚Äôve come to design and teach data science courses that emphasize morality
and ethics. They‚Äôll also learn how I design for inclusion and work to create
reflective learning environments.</p>

## Demystifying MLOps 

üí¨ Speaker: Isabel Zimmerman [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelizimm) | [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelizimm) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabel-zimmerman/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Data scientists have an intuition of what goes into training a machine learning
model, but building an MLOps strategy to deploy that model can sound daunting
for data science teams. Model services are not one-size-fits-all, so it is
imperative to know a range of tools available. One option, Vetiver, is a
framework for R and Python created to make model deployment feel like a natural
extension of a data scientist‚Äôs skill set.</p>
<p>This talk offers a high-level overview of what MLOps options are available for
model operationalization, but also shows a practical example of an end-to-end
MLOps deployment of a model-aware REST API using Vetiver.</p>

## Making Data Pipelines in R: A Story From A ‚ÄúSelf-Taught‚Äù Perspective 

üí¨ Speaker: Meghan S Harris [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meghansharris) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Meghansaha) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-harris/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>When people first learn about R‚Äôs capabilities to create fully integrated
systems, automated visuals, and seamless data pipelines, the reaction can span
from disbelief to amazement. R‚Äôs expansive capabilities can leave some feeling
overwhelmed when tasked with larger projects like data pipelines. This talk
invites the participant to hear the perspective of a self-taught R user who used
curiosity and patience to create a functional data pipeline in R for a local
health department. Specifically, this talk will touch on the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surveying Data Landscapes</li>
<li>File Structures</li>
<li>Saving Yourself with Data Validation</li>
<li>Modularizing Code and Connecting R Scripts</li>
<li>Thinking about Pipeline Sustainability</li>

üí¨ Speaker: Kelly O'Briant [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kellrstats) | [GitHub](https://github.com/kellobri) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyobriant/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>This summer the RStudio Connect team will announce a feature which has been over
two years in the making: ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù off-host content execution with launcher in
Kubernetes.</p>
<p>We have been quietly beta testing the Launcher feature with select partners and
customers for several months while we prepare for the public announcement.</p>
<p>This talk will highlight why someone might want to use this new execution
mode with Connect, show just how seamless it is to get everything configured
in a fresh environment on EKS, and finally set some critical context for what
publishers and administrators should expect by addressing the anticipated FAQs.</p>

## Do It For Yourself: Creating a data input platform using R 

üí¨ Speaker: Hezi Buba [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hezi_bu) | [GitHub](https://github.com/hezibu/) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>The Belmaker lab fieldwork involves underwater surveys where we document the
observed marine species. Historically, Microsoft‚Äôs Access was used for data
input. But as the number of surveyors increased, a new user-friendly platform
was needed to avoid bottlenecks. In this talk, I share my experience of
developing such a platform for the lab using tidyverse packages. This experience

## How Anchorage Built Alaska‚Äôs Vaccine Finder with R 

üí¨ Speaker: Ben Matheson [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmatheson) | [GitHub](https://github.com/benmatheson) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmatheson) 

üìù Abstract: <p>In January 2021, Alaska residents seeking a COVID-19 vaccine appointment faced
a convoluted maze of websites. The software was made for providers‚Äînot for
residents.</p>
<p>The Anchorage Innovation Team built a fast, and mobile vaccine finder website
for Alaska using R. What started as a web scraping prototype launched statewide
one week later and ultimately connected tens of thousands of Alaskans to a
vaccine.</p>
<p>This talk will cover how we used R to build Alaska's vaccine finder. Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scraping and http packages (rvest &amp; httr)</li>
<li>Using Heroku and S3 to run R jobs 24/7</li>
<li>Creating a flexible data service with R</li>
</ul>

## Garbage Data, And What To Do About Them 

üí¨ Speaker: Jim Kloet [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JimKloet) | [GitHub](https://github.com/jimtheflash) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkloet/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>No matter the requirements of the project, data are rarely ready for analysis
without some intervention up front, often described as cleaning or tidying up
your data. Researchers and data professionals employ many tools to make their
data usable for their needs; but, there exist data that are so far beneath the
threshold for usefulness that they cannot be used responsibly for analysis or
decision-making, i.e. ‚Äúbad data.‚Äù This talk proposes a framework for identifying
bad data, with examples from both academic and industry; identifies challenges
you might face from stakeholders when you identify bad data; and suggests
concrete steps you can take to overcome those challenges now and in the future.</p>

tools like JavaScript and php. With well organized git repos and Rmarkdown,
you can build websites for customers with embedded shiny apps and dynamic
visualizations and publish and deploy them using RStudio Connect. Using this
method, you won‚Äôt confine your analysis to static documents like PowerPoint
and pdfs and your customers will always see the latest and most up do date
information. The tools are out there to do this and it‚Äôs easy to start and
iterate with more features overtime.</p>

## R Shiny - From Conception to the Cloud 

üí¨ Speaker: Ivonne Carrillo Dominguez [Twitter]() | [GitHub]() | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivonne-carrillo-dominguez/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>I will share how we published an R Shiny application to AWS, the decisions we
made, and what we learned in the process.</p>
<p>One challenge we faced was figuring out how we could develop collaboratively. We
needed to define our development workflow, including version control, dependency
management, and quality assurance.</p>
<p>Then, we needed to define the deployment method. R Studio is great for
development, but it may hide many of the aspects that break the application. We
used CI/CD workflows as much as possible to make sure our code was robust before
pushing the changes to production.</p>
<p>Lastly, our infrastructure team designed a framework that is replicable, so we
are ready to deploy new R Shiny applications quickly and focus on data analysis.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Increasing quantity and types of available data and the need for more advance analyses are outpacing current tools in environmental science. R allows us to efficiently manipulate and analyze complex data; however, taking the first leap from a current workflow to automation can be challenging. This talk will focus on how to advocate for automation in a team with diverse skillsets. We‚Äôll start with examples of small changes that can be made using {officer} and {openxlsx} to meet your team members where they are by presenting results in a manner familiar to them; and finish by presenting a case study of how we used R to automate software from a regulatory agency.</p>

üí¨ Speaker: David Maguire [Twitter]() | [GitHub](https://github.com/davemaguire) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-maguire-30636956/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>R is often maligned as a poor fit for production deployment systems. At dv01 we
deploy Plumber API that serves machine learning models to Tape Cracker, a client
facing web application. With R in production we use the same codebase throughout
the data science pipeline, saving time and resources while reducing the chance
for bugs in the hand-off. To accomplish this we use industry standard continuous
integration and deployment tools to deploy our API to compute clusters in the
cloud. Our pipeline progresses stepwise through staging, release and production
environments. Automated integration testing at each step enables a robust and
reliable deployment. In this talk R users will learn strategies to deploy R code
in production environments.</p>

## Saving 1,000 hours with RStudio: selling R in your workplace 

üí¨ Speaker: Tiger Tang [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tigerloveslobs1) | [GitHub](https://github.com/CodingTigerTang) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chongtaitang/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>There are many benefits to using R and no lack of packages that help you solve technical difficulties, but you may still get stuck at selling it to decision-makers or implementing it at work. Tiger's recommendation is to start a project that focuses on automating work with R and gets everyone involved. Once the value of R has been established, selecting RStudio Workbench and RStudio Connect for streamlining tasks would not be a difficult choice.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Tiger's organization moved away from SAS in favor of R for modeling projects, but there wasn‚Äôt much initiative taken company-wide to move everything to a new tool. To help change that, he started a work automation project using R that has saved 12K+ hours of manual work.</p>
<p>In this talk, he will share the key parts of the project, lessons learned, and a structure you can follow if you would like to do something similar in your organization.</p>

Shiny app provides a low-cost decision-making tool for the Ministry of Health
in C√¥t√© d‚ÄôIvoire. Using lpSolve library, we optimize for factors like eligible
population in catchment area of vaccination sites, types and number of vaccine
doses, expiration date of vaccine does, availability of trained healthcare
staff, and presence of cold storage facility. The app maximizes number of people
vaccinated while minimizing vaccine wastage across thousands of vaccination
sites. (App development will end on May 31)</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Machine learning models, applied in the real world, can have unanticipated,
harmful side effects. Recommended counter-measures include structured
documentation of models (&quot;Model Cards for Model Reporting&quot;) and training data
used (&quot;Data Sheets for Datasets&quot;).</p>
<p>In this talk, I'd like to propose a similar, multi-dimensional approach to
analyzing the &quot;solution&quot; as a whole - &quot;solution&quot; as in &quot;tech solutionism&quot;, the
common term for technical &quot;fixes&quot; that have unintended, harmful consequences.</p>
<p>The idea here is that, by asking WHAT a solution is doing, WHO is providing
it and WHY, as well as WHERE and HOW it will be used, we should be able to
systematically assess whether we are, in fact, confronted with an instance of
tech solutionism.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Sometimes, we want a model that generates a range of possible outcomes around
each prediction. Other times, we just care about point predictions and may
opt to use a fancy model like XGBoost. But what if we want the best of both
worlds: getting a range of predictions while still using a fancy model? That‚Äôs
where bootstrapping comes to the rescue! By using bootstrap resampling, we can
create many models that produce a prediction distribution ‚Äì regardless of the
model type! In this talk, I‚Äôll give an overview of bootstrap resampling for
prediction, the pros/cons of this method, and how to implement it as a part of a
tidymodel workflow with the workboots package.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>The first step of any data analysis is importing data, but for tables in a
database this can be a surprisingly challenging step that takes analysts out
of their workflow. The dbcooper package turns a database connection into a
collection of accessor functions, letting users take advantage of autocomplete
as they browse a database in the same ways they would engage with local tables.
I'll walk through how dbcooper can be used to build a database-specific package,
whether for an organization's internal use or to wrap a public data source. The
dbcooper package supports both R (built on top of dbplyr) and Python (built on
top of siuba), and in either language makes it easy and intuitive to extract
insights from a database.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Society benefits when leaders make more evidence-based decisions, but growing
privacy concerns hamper researchers‚Äô ability to understand and improve the
world. Fully synthetic data, pseudo data generated by models, can protect
confidentiality and produce statistically valid analysis. This talk shares how
the Urban Institute collaborates with the IRS to create fully synthetic tax data
for tax policy research. We built an R package called tidysynthesis to create
machine learning models for each variable in the data. tidysynthesis leverages
the power of tidymodels and allows users to run a sequences of machine learning
models with different recipes, engines, and samplers while adding additional
noise and enforcing logical constraints.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>In this talk, I will highlight a few selected new features of the knitr package
introduced in the past two years including: 1) the new way to write chunk
options as &quot;#|&quot; comments in the chunk body; 2) new ways to reuse both chunk body
and chunk options from another code chunk; 3) a few useful new engines, namely
<code>comment</code> (comment out arbitrary content), <code>verbatim</code> (write arbitrary verbatim
content), <code>embed</code> (embed external files and display their content verbatim), and
<code>exec</code> (execute an arbitrary command); and 4) a few new chunk options such as
<code>file</code> (to include external files as the chunk body) and <code>lang</code>. Hopefully these
new features can help both knitr users and developers make better use of knitr.</p>

## Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis in the tidyverse 

üí¨ Speaker: Josiah Parry [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josiahParry/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/josiahparry) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josiahparry/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>R has come quite a long way to enable spatial analysis over the past few years.
Packages such as sf have made spatial analysis and mapping easier for many.
However, adoption of R for spatial statistics and econometrics has been limited.
Many spatial analysts, researchers, and practitioners lean on Python libraries
such as pysal.</p>
<p>In this talk I briefly discuss my journey through spatial analysis and introduce
a new package sfdep which provides a tidy interface to spatial statistics and
noteably exploratory spatial data analysis. sfdep is an interface to the spdep
package as well as implements other common exploratory spatial statistics.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Internal packages are great for boosting productivity and promoting good
practice, but what kinds of challenges do we face when designing solutions
for multi-lingual teams? Here I will advocate for a design approach we are
using at Bumble to build Python and R packages with the same foundations.
I will discuss the benefits of this approach for the developer and the

## I made an entire e-commerce platform on Shiny 

üí¨ Speaker: Jacqueline Nolis [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skyetetra) | [GitHub](https://github.com/jnolis/ggirl) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jnolis) 

üìù Abstract: <p>E-commerce requires passing data between many components like managing a
shopping cart, taking payment, fulfilling orders, and sending emails. I've
successfully created a full e-commerce platform entirely in R for a quirky side
project. The R package ggirl lets users order ggplot2 plots as postcards and
more via R functions. Those R functions pass data to a separate Shiny app, which
then passes data other services like Stripe payment APIs and printing APIs. In
this talk I will walk through how to use packages like httr, callr, and brochure
to have your Shiny apps call external services and do many tasks in parallel.
You‚Äôll leave the talk with more ways to use Shiny than dashboards plus the
knowledge to monetize your existing dashboards!</p>

üí¨ Speaker: Caro Buck [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caroissilly) | [GitHub](https://github.com/carobuck) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caro-buck/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Data literacy is a tool to build understanding- of the world and ourselves.
Data, AI and tech are sometimes portrayed as scary and unknowable; however,
data can be for everyone. Data, and decisions based off data, have enormous
implications in our daily lives. We (data practitioners) likely have some
baseline understanding of numbers and how to read a chart. But others, whether
our friends, family members or coworkers, might not have the same level of
understanding.</p>
<p>This talk will address how to talk to these seemingly &quot;non-data&quot; people, the
benefits of talking data with them, and (hopefully) encourage more curiosity and
wonder at the creativity of data. We will also briefly cover what data literacy
is and why we ought to care about it.</p>

## WebR: R compiled for WebAssembly and running in the browser 

üí¨ Speaker: George Stagg [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gwstagg) | [GitHub](https://github.com/georgestagg) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>In this talk I introduce webR, a port of R to WebAssembly using Emscripten.
WebR brings a full R environment to the browser, enabling R code execution,
numerical analysis, loading packages and more. No local or cloud-based R
servers are required as all computation is performed within the browser.
I give a brief overview of our build process for webR, describing the toolchain
and some of the issues we encountered. A publicly available web-based R session
is demonstrated, with package and plotting support.</p>

## It's about time 

üí¨ Speaker: Davis Vaughan [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dvaughan32) | [GitHub](https://github.com/DavisVaughan) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>Dealing with date-times is hard. Dealing with date-times without the proper
tooling is even harder! clock is an R package that aims to provide comprehensive
and safe handling of date-times. It goes beyond the date and date-time types
that base R provides, implementing new types for year-month, year-quarter, ISO
year-week, and many other date-like formats, all with up to nanosecond
precision. In this talk, you'll see how clock emphasizes &quot;safety first&quot; when
manipulating date-times, and how these new date-time types can be used in your
own work.</p>

## Let your mobile shine - Leveraging CSS concepts to make shiny apps mobile responsive 

üí¨ Speaker: Shelmith Nyagathiri Kariuki [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shel_Kariuki) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Shelmith-Kariuki) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelmith-kariuki-44351363/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>As shiny developers, we spend a lot of time working on the server side, and
less time on the UI/UX part. According to the Engineering Production-Grade Shiny
Apps book by the ThinkR team, no matter how complex and innovative your back-
end is, your application is bad if your user experience (UX) is bad. People
spend more time on the internet from their mobile phones, so it is important to
ensure that our shiny apps are mobile responsive. At the beginning of this year,
I was tasked with creating a mobile version of an already made shiny app in the
shortest time possible. In this talk, as much as this work is tied to an NDA, I
will highlight a few css tricks that I used to achieve this.</p>

## Accelerating geospatial computing using Apache Arrow 

üí¨ Speaker: Dewey Dunnington [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paleolimbot) | [GitHub](https://github.com/paleolimbot/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deweydunnington/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>The ‚Äòarrow‚Äô R package and wider Apache Arrow ecosystem provide an end-to-
end solution for querying and computing on in-memory and bigger-than-memory
data sets using the Apache Arrow C++ library. In this talk we introduce the
‚Äògeoarrow‚Äô package, which extends Arrow to provide efficient columnar storage
for spatial types and functions to support spatial queries in the Arrow compute
engine. We focus on a workflow where (1) data are stored in multiple files
that can be hosted remotely (e.g., on S3-compatible storage), (2) queries are
processed batchwise and in parallel allowing for efficient processing of bigger-
than-memory geospatial data and (3) results can be passed without copying to
Rust, Python, or other R packages for further analysis.</p>

üí¨ Speaker: Melissa Van Bussel [Twitter]() | [GitHub](https://github.com/melissavanbussel) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissavanbussel/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Some of my best friends use Python...and all of my coworkers use SAS.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada is the official statistical agency of Canada and employs
over 6,000 employees. Statistics Canada has a legal obligation to ensure
that personal information collected for statistical purposes is kept strictly
confidential. An internal system which prevents the release of confidential
information is only implemented in SAS. As such, many Analysts and Data
Scientists at Statistics Canada must use the SAS programming language as part of
their workflow. It is therefore imperative to find ways to work with open source
programming languages and SAS seamlessly. I will present a method for achieving
a harmonious workflow between R, Python, and SAS, all within RStudio.</p>

may help run R scripts; or we may need to generate outputs in Word or Excel.
Just as pollinators support biodiversity, we believe R users can be constructive
members of diverse data ecosystems. Our talk will: (1) outline what it means to
be constructive, (2) highlight tools that can help R users contribute to their
ecosystems, and (3) describe practices that can improve workflows involving
diverse groups of staff and software. We hope our talk will inspire R users
to think creatively and empathetically about how R can be a force for good in
diverse data ecosystems.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Interactive maps are indispensable tools for exploring spatial datasets
because of their real-world context and intuitiveness. For a comprehensive
understanding of the data, it is often necessary to switch between
several map layers (such as states and counties) and to analyze multiple
variables simultaneously - both of which are challenging. In this talk,
I will show how we can overcome these challenges using the
leafdown package, which allows us to create multi-layer maps embedded
in Shiny apps.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Over the years, the R community has experienced an increase in the number,
diversity and domain background of users. However, incorporation of R in the
field of Robotics is still not fully exploited even though the actuation of
manipulators such as robotic arms is based on streams of input data gathered
from sensors. With R constantly evolving and redefining how to turn data into
actionable insights, any domain that produces data now has the potential to use
R. What if this actionable insight means actuating a robotic arm? The aim of
this talk is to connect two previously separated worlds: robotic application
development and the data manipulation capabilities of R by demonstrating how to
actuate a Robotic arm using R and Arduino.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Multilingual shiny apps are not straightforward to build. Translation affects
almost every single aspect of an app. Although there are a few packages designed
to automate the translation process, they tend to only work for the most widely
spoken languages.</p>
<p>Using a bilingual English-Welsh shiny app we developed to present public health

<ul>
<li>how we built a multilingual shiny app;</li>
<li>how translation affected design decisions;</li>
<li>how we overcame the main issues faced;</li>
<li>and most importantly, what we'd do differently next time.</li>

## Implications of R syntax in intro stats 

üí¨ Speaker: Amelia McNamara [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN) | [GitHub](https://github.com/AmeliaMN) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>This talk reports on a head-to-head comparison of the formula and tidyverse
syntaxes in a full semester introductory statistics course, providing data to
help guide other instructors in their pedagogical decision-making. The formula
version of the class used the mosaic package for summary statistics, ggformula
for graphics, and base functions such as t.test for inference. The tidyverse
section used base functions inside summarize() calls for summary statistics,
ggplot2 for graphics, and functions such as infer::t_test for inference.
Analysis of materials allows us to determine the number of functions students
were exposed to in each section, which functions they actually used, and how
much time they spent on their assignments in each class.</p>

## Comparing package versions with Diffify 

üí¨ Speaker: Colin Gillespie [Twitter](https://twitter.com/csgillespie) | [GitHub](https://github.com/csgillespie/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-gillespie-25028332/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Even when we run the simplest of R scripts, we are using dozens of R packages.
We use packages for data cleaning, writing reports, graphics and modelling. One
of the strengths of R, is the depth of packages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, packages change and break our code. Not all R packages have NEWS
file, and even those that do, it might not be complete.</p>
<p>The diffify service aims to make comparing between package versions easier.
For example, is there a new Import? Or perhaps a package has been removed from
Suggests? Maybe the arguments of a function have changed? Or a function is no
longer exported. Diffify can help.</p>
<p>NB: We have completed the back-end infrastructure, and are currently working on
the front-end. Expected launch: ~May 1st</p>

## Running Shiny without a server 

üí¨ Speaker: Winston Chang [Twitter](https://twitter.com/winston_chang) | [GitHub](https://github.com/wch) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>Shiny for Python has the ability to be deployed without a server that runs Python. These applications can be served by any web hosting service. They are easily deployed and can scale to handle large amounts of traffic.</p>
<p>This mode of deployment is called <strong>Shinylive</strong>. It works by running Python in the user‚Äôs web browser, using Pyodide, which is a version of Python that is compiled to WebAssembly. Shinylive opens up new possibilities for how Shiny applications can be used. In this talk I discuss the advantages and the limitations of Shinylive applications.</p>

## An Introduction to the Apple Health Export 

üí¨ Speaker: John Goldin [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johngoldin) | [GitHub](https://github.com/johngoldin) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>After a visit to the ER, I discovered an ocean of personal data: more than 3
million rows of data about one of my favorite subjects: me. My watch averages
almost 5,000 measurements a day. That experience led me to explore the Apple
Health Export in more detail. It‚Äôs the largest dataset I‚Äôve ever worked with.
The variety of sources and the quantity data can be overwhelming. I will
describe the basic measurements that are available and some of the things
one needs to be on the lookout for. A ggplot of a full day of heart rate data
provided me (and my doctor) important context on two occasions when I went to
the ER. Fortunately there‚Äôs no great medical drama involved, but the plots are
pretty neat and actually turned out to be helpful.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>This session highlights two anomaly detection use cases in production:
identification of problematic life sciences manufacturing units and
identification of significant newsworthy events. With both solutions, Shiny is
integrated with live data to provide early detection for proactive intervention.
Shiny‚Äôs intuitive user interface also allows for interaction with the data
behind anomalies to uncover potential causes and paths to action or resolution.</p>
<p>The session also briefly highlights a rapid prototyping development approach
with Shiny. This technique allows for collaborative refinement of the underlying
anomaly detection model in R, quickly incorporating user feedback, where end
users may not have in-depth machine learning knowledge.</p>

## Visualizing distributions and uncertainty using ggdist 

üí¨ Speaker: Matthew Kay [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjskay) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mjskay) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>I propose a talk on visualizing distributions and uncertainty using {ggdist}.
I will describe how to think systematically about distributional visualization
as mappings of PDFs, CDFs, and quantile functions onto aesthetics, and how
support for this enables creative and easy exploration of the space of possible
uncertainty visualizations. I will highlight features like true gradient support
in R 4.1, support for distribution vector datatypes, and the automatic binwidth-
selecting geom_dots(). I expect to leave the audience with: (1) a systemic
way to think about visualizing distributions and uncertainty in the grammar of
graphics and (2) an understanding of how to actually do it using ggdist.</p>

## The Future of missing data 

üí¨ Speaker: Nicholas Tierney [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney) | [GitHub](https://github.com/njtierney) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nj-tierney/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>If you do data analysis, you encounter missing data. Missing data upsets data
analysis workflow because you have to make decisions on how to deal with it -
do you impute the values? Remove them? These each have consequences! The data we
often encounter does not always arrive with a research question in mind, so how
do you understand why you have missing values? When I first encountered missing
data I was incredibly frustrated at how hard it was to understand and explore
it. This frustration led me to create two R packages to explore missing data,
{naniar} and {visdat}. In this talk I will showcase how to use these tools to
explore missing data, as well as new features that have not been presented, and
planned advances.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Many companies within the insurance and financial sector maintain a large
number of legacy models in the platform Microsoft Excel. With the advent of
data analytics, many of these same companies are now looking to migrate their
existing models from an Excel environment into an R environment. This process,
however, is not foolproof. I should know as I have had to do it several times!
Having made many mistakes myself, I would like to provide some tips to help
future analysts and companies outside of the technology industry overcome some
common pitfalls that they may encounter during the model migration process.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Data suggests that less than 3% of data scientists are women of color. My
journey and that of many other women who fall at the intersection of being
underrepresented in this field is one that is often filled with pitfalls and
curves that can result in continued exclusion in these spaces. My journey as a
historically excluded double minority in STEM is one of triumph, but not without
the community educational tools, online platforms and genuinely inclusive
members of the R Studio and open science communities. My work explores how we
can build on these tools and further propel the use of open science as a tool
for equity and diversity in STEM, now more than ever.</p>

## A new way to build your Shiny app's UI 

üí¨ Speaker: Nick Strayer [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nstrayer) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickstrayer/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Shiny helps data scientists create web applications without requiring web development experience. However, there's still a steep learning curve for writing the Ui portion of an app. Unlike an app's server code, which typically only uses a few different Shiny-specific functions, the app's UI code is almost entirely made up of functions with strange syntaxes and often surprising interactions with each other. This paradigm requires a very different mindset than your typical R Script. This talk introduces a new tool to help both new and experienced Shiny developers spend less time writing their app's UI and more time doing data science.</p>

Using a case study from an administrative higher education office, learn how
you can begin to build your own R ecosystem, step by step, to increase the
efficiency and impact of your work, even as a solo contributor. Start from
scratch and get small wins by replacing common Excel tasks with reproducible
code, and then continue to develop iteratively, incorporating more of R‚Äôs
capabilities into your workflow until you‚Äôre humming along with internal
packages and parameterized reporting. We‚Äôll discuss how R can ease the burden

üìù Abstract: <p>Demystifying the Art of creating custom Libraries for your organization. Imagine
a world where a company has its own R library, this stores the most common
functions an analytical team uses. From connecting to the Database to reading
in SQL from a SQL file to creating custom graphs that only take in a few inputs.
In today's world, we find that code is siloed on many Analyst machines. Even
though the same code is being used over and over again by the same person or
multiple people carry on with this architecture. We scramble to figure out where
we save that nice code chunk so that we can use it on another package. Instead,
we can all leverage creating our own libraries that store and document the cool
features we've created.</p>

Excel spreadsheets. This was highly time consuming, error prone, and lacked
traceability. To improve this workflow, I developed an R package that reduced
processing time by 95%. The package has since become integral to our data
pipeline, including quality control, analysis, visualization, and report
generation in RMarkdown. The resulting datasets have already proven invaluable
to industry leaders looking to invest in Nova Scotia‚Äôs coastal resources.</p>

## Cracking open ggplot internals with {ggtrace} 

üí¨ Speaker: June Choe [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yjunechoe) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>The inner workings of {ggplot2} are difficult to grasp even for experienced
users because its internal object-oriented (ggproto) system is hidden from user-
facing functions, by design. This is exacerbated by the foreignness of ggproto
itself, which remains the largest hurdle in the user-to-developer transition.
However this needs not to be the case: ggplot internals have clear parallels to
data wrangling, where data is passed between methods that take inputs and return
outputs. Capitalizing on this connection, package {ggtrace} exposes the familiar
functional programming logic of ggplot with functions that inspect, capture, or
modify steps in a ggplot object's execution pipeline, enabling users to learn
the internals through trial-and-error.</p>

## Becoming Creative: How I Designed a Quilt with R 

üí¨ Speaker: Alice Walsh [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sciencealice) | [GitHub](https://github.com/awalsh17) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-walsh/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>When someone asks about essential skills for data careers, I often hear
responses like R, Python, and machine learning. However, I argue that creativity
is an underrated skill that you can and should practice. In this talk, I want
to tell you a story about a project I did to stretch my creative brain and use
my favorite tool, R. I designed a quilt in R using generative art ideas. Then
I created individual blocks that make up the larger design. I used foundation
paper piecing, a method that allows for intricate designs but has geometrical
constraints. I hope my talk will entertain and inspire folks to exercise their
creative muscles to improve their performance and enjoyment of their day jobs.</p>

üìù Abstract: <p>Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown, and comes with a new presentation
format, revealjs. In this talk, I‚Äôll show a few of my favorite things about
making interactive HTML presentations with Quarto. Along the way you‚Äôll
learn about the visual editor, multiple columns, delivering an effective talk
with speaker notes and mode, making your presentations pop with transitions,
effective ways to incorporate code into your presentation, beautiful themes
(and how to match your corporate style guide), and sharing it as pdf and HTML.
I‚Äôll finish off with a brief look at generating a powerpoint presentation from a

## From summarizing projects to setting tags, uses of parsing R files 

üí¨ Speaker: Bryan Shalloway [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brshallo) | [GitHub](https://github.com/brshallo) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanshalloway) 

üìù Abstract: <p>I'll walk through a few potential uses of parsing out the functions and packages in projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a reference table: With so many #rstats learning materials out there, it's often helpful to parse-out the functions from a project and create a lookup table that complements your notes.</li>
<li>Analyzing files: A network visualization of the packages may provide insights as to which files or projects are most related to one another as well as which packages are most central to a body of work.</li>
<li>Setting tags: Picking good consistent tags for your blogdown website is hard. It's easier to just parse out the packages in each post and use those to organize your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples will use helpers from the new {funspotr} package: https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr/</p>

## A Robust Framework for Automated Shiny App Testing 

üí¨ Speaker: Sydeaka Watson [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SydeakaWatson) | [GitHub](https://github.com/sydeaka) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydeakawatson/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>For production-grade Shiny applications, regression testing ensures that the
application maintains its core functionality as new features are added to the
app. With the help of various R and Python tools that programmatically interact
with the UI and examine UI outputs, regression test logic can be represented
programmatically and can run as often as needed. This gives the development team
an opportunity to catch and fix bugs before they are pushed to production.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce a framework for automated testing of Shiny
applications both (1) during the development phase and (2) after the app is
deployed. I will share a demo Shiny app along with relevant shinytest2 and
Selenium code.</p>

## Literate Programming With Jupyter Notebooks and Quarto 

üí¨ Speaker: Hamel Husain [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) | [GitHub](https://github.com/hamelsmu) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Jupyter Notebooks play a critical role in in the workflow of many users. Notebooks are used to document existing code, to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas, and as a medium of technical communication. However, package developers typically use an entirely separate set of more traditional development tools, and the context switching between these tools and notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev">Nbdev</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming framework</a> that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks. In this talk, Hamel will describe the integration between Nbdev amd Quarto, which enables library developers to author their documentation right alongside their code, and automatically produce a Quarto website for their package. The result is a seamless workflow for developing, documenting, and testing software packages all within Jupyter Notebooks, with no context-switching required.</p>

## An introduction to R7 

üí¨ Speaker: Hadley Wickham [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/hadley) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>The R7 package is a new OOP system designed to be a successor to S3 and S4. It
has been designed and implemented collaboratively by the RConsortium Object-
Oriented Programming Working Group, which includes representatives from R-Core,
BioConductor, RStudio/tidyverse, and the wider R community.</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll introduce R7 to the wider world. Attendees will learn why we
created R7 and how they can use it to create new classes and packages. I hope to
inspire folks to download, try it out, and give us the feedback we need to make
it better.</p>

## {shinytest2}: Regression testing for Shiny applications 

üí¨ Speaker: Barret Schloerke [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schloerke) | [GitHub](https://github.com/schloerke) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schloerke/) 

üìù Abstract: <p>Manually testing Shiny applications is often laborious, inconsistent, and
doesn‚Äôt scale well. Whether you are developing new features, fixing bug(s),
or simply upgrading dependencies, it is critical to know when regressions are
introduced. The new {shinytest2} R package provides a toolkit for unit testing
Shiny apps and seamlessly integrates with {testthat}. Under the hood, it uses
the new {chromote} R package to render apps in a headless Chrome browser with
features such as live preview and built in debugging tools. In this talk,
you‚Äôll learn how to test Shiny apps by simply recording your actions as code
and extending it to test more particular aspects of your app, resulting in fewer
bugs and more confidence in future development.</p>

## The Polygons of Another World - realtime interactive rendering in R

üìù Abstract: <p>In this talk I want to explore R's capabilities for fast, interactive graphical applications.  This exploration is driven by my ongoing port of the 1991 action adventure game &quot;Another World&quot;, but these capabilities also open up possibilities for new visualisations and applications in R.</p>
<p>The porting of this game is a 'moonshot' project as I try to discover the techniques and tools needed for fast (&gt;20fps) interactive (keyboard + mouse) rendering to R graphics devices. A further constraint is that I want all this to be done in plain R - avoiding any C or javascript as much as possible.</p>
<p>I will discuss three of the key challenges faced: graphics device speed, fast double-buffered rendering and event-driven programming for interactivity.</p>
<p>I will showcase the capability of R to render 5000 moving sprites using the <code>nara</code> package, an interactive drum machine with the <code>eventloop</code> package, and my progress with the 'Another World' game engine with animation, keyboard control and synchronised sound.</p>

## Data science training in communities with limited technology resources and opportunities 

üí¨ Speaker: Jeff Leek [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jtleek) | [GitHub](https://github.com/jtleek) | [LinkedIn]() 

üìù Abstract: <p>I'm so excited to be back with the data science community at rstudio::conf!
Data science is a field that touches nearly every part of our modern lives - from the shows we watch, to our jobs, to the economy, to sports and entertainment.
Moreover, modern technologies like cloud computing and access to increasing volumes of data have opened the door to incredible new opportunities for those with data skill.
<a href="https://rladies.org/">RLadies</a>, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>, <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, and <a href="https://rstudio.com">RStudio</a> have also done an incredible job of creating a supportive community for these new data scientists to flourish.
But not everyone gets equal access to the training that can pull them into this field.</p>
<p>In this talk I will describe a collaborative effort to build <a href="https://www.datatrail.org/">DataTrail</a> - a data science program created in partnership with local non-profits in Baltimore that seeks to spread awareness, knowledge, and opportunities into historically under-resourced and under-served communities.
I will highlight the incredible work of the partners who made this training program possible, show examples of the achievements of DataTrail participants, discuss successes and challenges with the program, and talk about the rewards of being a part of community-based data science education.
Finally, I will highlight opportunities to be a part of our DataTrail community or build a new DataTrail in yours.</p>
